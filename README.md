## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on the manipulation of date objects. A horoscope was the perfect opportunity to practice between date types.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

It would have been nice to get a current date function that checks the current date and alters the horoscope output. Not too much optimization needed as (I think) my code was pretty lean, but maybe I will think otherwise in the future. 

## Lessons Learned:

Date Object Methods are troublesome. It took a couple tries to get it right and I eventually just used string methods to finish up the app. I would have loved to get all od the Date Object Methods to work how I expected them.
